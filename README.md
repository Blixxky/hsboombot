# Installation

This project requires Python 3.11 (like MFB-Realive)
[Download Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

1. Download the repo.
2. Set Hearthstone to windowed 1024x768 and open it up to the Solo Adventures - The Boomsday Project Puzzle Lab screen below. Make sure Puzzle Lab is highlighted.
3. Run launch.bat (be patient as it has to initialize and install dependencies). Leave the Hearthstone window in the foreground without any obstruction.

It has a long ~20 minute wait before quitting the game. If it looks like it's doing nothing you are correct as this is how the exp is accrued.

To stop the bot, simply close the terminal window, or put it in focus and CTRL+C to terminate.

# Warning

Blizzard is known to ban people for botting. Even though it is Solo play, don't go on extremely long marathons as it stands out in their metrics.
